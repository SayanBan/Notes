A thread is a flow of execution through the process code, with its own program counter that keeps track of which instruction to execute next, 
system registers which hold its current working variables, and a stack which contains the execution history.

A thread ***shares*** with its peer threads few information like code segment, data segment and open files. When one thread alters 
a code segment memory item, all other threads see that.

A thread is also called a ***lightweight process***. Threads provide a way to improve application performance through parallelism. 
Threads represent a software approach to improving performance of operating system by reducing the overhead thread is equivalent to a classical process.

***Advantages of Thread***

    Threads minimize the context switching time.
    Use of threads provides concurrency within a process.
    Efficient communication.
    It is more economical to create and context switch threads.
    Threads allow utilization of multiprocessor architectures to a greater scale and efficiency.

***Types of Thread***

    Threads are implemented in following two ways −
    User Level Threads − User managed threads.
    Kernel Level Threads − Operating System managed threads acting on kernel, an operating system core.

***Kernel Level Threads***

In this case, thread management is done by the Kernel. There is no thread management code in the application area. Kernel threads are supported directly 
by the operating system. Any application can be programmed to be multithreaded. All of the threads within an application are supported within a single process.

**Advantages**

    Kernel can simultaneously schedule multiple threads from the same process on multiple processes.
    If one thread in a process is blocked, the Kernel can schedule another thread of the same process.
    Kernel routines themselves can be multithreaded.

**Disadvantages**

    Kernel threads are generally slower to create and manage than the user threads.
    Transfer of control from one thread to another within the same process requires a mode switch to the Kernel
    
***User Level Threads***

In this case, the thread management kernel is not aware of the existence of threads. The thread library contains code for creating and destroying threads, 
for passing message and data between threads, for scheduling thread execution and for saving and restoring thread contexts. The application starts with 
a single thread.

**Advantages**

    Thread switching does not require Kernel mode privileges.
    User level thread can run on any operating system.
    Scheduling can be application specific in the user level thread.
    User level threads are fast to create and manage.

**Disadvantages**

    In a typical operating system, most system calls are blocking.
    Multithreaded application cannot take advantage of multiprocessing
