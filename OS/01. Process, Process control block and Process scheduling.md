***PROCESS***

A process is defined as an entity which represents the basic unit of work to be implemented in the system.

**Process creation:**

A process may be created in the system for different operations. Some of the events that lead to process creation are as follows −

      User request for process creation
      System Initialization
      Batch job initialization
      Execution of a process creation system call by a running process
      
A process may be created by another process using fork(). The creating process is called the parent process and the created process is the child process. A child process can have only one parent but a parent process may have many children. Both the parent and child processes have the same memory image, open files and environment strings. However, they have distinct address spaces.

A program is a piece of code which may be a single line or millions of lines. 
A computer program is usually written by a computer programmer in a programming language

A computer program is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task when executed by a computer. 
When we compare a program with a process, we can conclude that a process is a dynamic instance of a computer program.

**A part of a computer program that performs a well-defined task is known as an algorithm.**
**A collection of computer programs, libraries and related data are referred to as a software.**

When a process executes, it passes through different states. These stages may differ in different operating systems, 
and the names of these states are also not standardized.

***PROCESS CONTROL BLOCK(PCB)***

A Process Control Block is a data structure maintained by the Operating System for every process. The PCB is identified by an integer process ID (PID). 
A PCB keeps all the information needed to keep track of a process as listed below in the table −

The PCB is maintained for a process throughout its lifetime, and is deleted once the process terminates.

***PROCESS SCHEDULING***

The process scheduling is the activity of the process manager that handles the removal of the running process from the CPU and the selection
of another process on the basis of a particular strategy.

**Process Scheduling Queues**

The OS maintains all PCBs in Process Scheduling Queues. The OS maintains a separate queue for each of the process states and PCBs of all 
processes in the same execution state are placed in the same queue.

The Operating System maintains the following important process scheduling queues −

    **Job queue** − This queue keeps all the processes in the system.

    **Ready queue** − This queue keeps a set of all processes residing in main memory, ready and waiting to execute. A new process is always put in this queue.

    **Device queues** − The processes which are blocked due to unavailability of an I/O device constitute this queue.

The OS scheduler determines how to move processes between the ready and run queues which can only have one entry per processor core on the system.
