I am a student from India, currently giving exams to start my MBA. I have no job which makes it impossible to carry even my own expenses or pay for a certified course. So I really need financial aid. This is the only way I can take this certified course. Also, because of this pandemic situation, job prospects and college placement, and everything else have messed up. The chances of getting a job have gone down. So it is really necessary skills which are in demand. My father is the only earning person in my family but he already is paying a large amount of money for the home loan so I cannot ask him to pay for my certifications. I am currently looking for business-related roles for internships and jobs, so this certification will help me get that. There is literally no other better course provider available than Coursera and everyone knows that. So, It would really be very helpful if you please grant me financial aid.
