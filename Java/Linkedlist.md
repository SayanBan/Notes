# Linked List

* Linked List can be defined as collection of objects called nodes that are randomly stored in the memory.
* A node contains two fields i.e. data stored at that particular address and the pointer which contains the address of the next node in the memory.
* The last node of the list contains pointer to the null.

***Reason why linkedlist is chosen over Array***

* The size of array must be known in advance before using it in the program.
* Increasing size of the array is a time taking process. It is almost impossible to expand the size of the array at run time.
* All the elements in the array need to be contiguously stored in the memory. Inserting any element in the array needs shifting of all its predecessors.
