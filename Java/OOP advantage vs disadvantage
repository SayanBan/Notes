**Low cost**

Especially for larger projects, OOP helps reduce the cost of programming labor. Staff working on a project can develop their own library of software objects, 
letting programmers use each other's work easily and reducing the hours needed to develop programs.


**Better produtivity**
Programs that don't use OOP tend to be large, continuous slabs of text. Error correction is way easier than those in conventional programming.

Disadvantage -

Slower software and Learning curve is higher.

Object-oriented software can entail extra housekeeping code not necessary in other computer languages

You have to learn polymrphism encapsulation , inheritence etc for OOP
