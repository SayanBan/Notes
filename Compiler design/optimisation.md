Optimization is a program transformation technique, which tries to improve the code by making it consume less resources (i.e. CPU, Memory) and deliver high speed.

In optimization, high-level general programming constructs are replaced by very efficient low-level programming codes. 
A code optimizing process must follow the three rules given below:

  *  The output code must not, in any way, change the meaning of the program.

  *  Optimization should increase the speed of the program and if possible, the program should demand less number of resources.

  *  Optimization should itself be fast and should not delay the overall compiling process.
  
 Efforts for an optimized code can be made at various levels of compiling the process.

  *  At the beginning, users can change/rearrange the code or use better algorithms to write the code.

  *  After generating intermediate code, the compiler can modify the intermediate code by address calculations and improving loops.

  *  While producing the target machine code, the compiler can make use of memory hierarchy and CPU registers.

Optimization can be categorized broadly into two types : machine independent and machine dependent.
