1) Conventional programming divides the problem into functions but object oriented programming divides the problem into a number of entities called object.

2) Conventional programming represents non real modeling but object oriented programming represents real world modeling like the parents' child concept, inheritance.

3) Conventional programming follows a top-down approach but object oriented programming follow bottom-up approach.

4) Conventional programming does not support reusability but object oriented programming support reusability the code.

5)  Conventional programming is used for designing medium sized application, maintenance and modification of large complex system 
    is time consuming and costly. Object oriented programming is used for designing large and complex applications, maintenance and 
    modification of large and complex system is relatively less time consuming and costly
