Syntax analysis or parsing is the second phase of a compiler. In this chapter, we shall learn the basic concepts used in the construction of a parser.

lexical analyzer can identify tokens with the help of regular expressions and pattern rules. But a lexical analyzer cannot check the syntax of a 
given sentence due to the limitations of the regular expressions. Regular expressions cannot check balancing tokens, such as parenthesis. Therefore, 
this phase uses context-free grammar (CFG), which is recognized by push-down automata.

**CFG**, on the other hand, is a superset of Regular Grammar, as depicted below:
