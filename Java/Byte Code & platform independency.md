java bytecode is the machine code in the form of a .class file. With the help of java bytecode we achieve platform independence in java.

When we write a program in Java, firstly, the compiler compiles that program and a bytecode is generated for that piece of code.


**Independency**

Whenever, a program is written in JAVA, the javac compiles it.


The result of the JAVA compiler is the .class file or the bytecode and not the machine native code (unlike C compiler).


The bytecode generated is a non-executable code and needs an interpreter to execute on a machine. This interpreter is the 
JVM and thus the Bytecode is executed by the JVM.


And finally program runs to give the desired output.
