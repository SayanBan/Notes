Socket programming is a way of how applications will be communicating with eath other over the internet.

* A port is a virtual point where network connections start and end.
* A port is a number used to uniquely identify a transaction over a network by specifying both the host, and the service.
* IP address stands for internet protocol address; it is an identifying number that is associated with a specific computer or computer network. When connected to the   internet, the IP address allows the computers to send and receive information.
* A media access control address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller for use as a network address in communications within a network segment.

      What is Socket()?
      
      Socket is the first function that the system calls. It's function is to activate the end point/node/machine. So we are initializing the endpoint using socket.
      
      There are 3 things/parameters inside the socket -
        
        1. Domain - It specifies whether I am using an ip of v6 network or v4 network.
        
        2. Type - Specifies whether we are using the datagram service or whether we use the stream service, i.e.,
                  Also, whether I am using TCP or UDP. If we are using tcp, we can use sock_stream. If we use Datagram or UDP, we can use Sock_DGRAM.
                  
        3. Protocol - We usually pass zero as a value in protocol as this argument is not typically used when allocating a socket.
     
      Socket is an node/endpoint/machine.
      
      In application layer, data is generated by some application which has to be tranfered
      to the node of the other machine.
      
Now once the Socket() has been initialized, we use **Bind()** fucntion -
      
        What is Bind()?
        
        Bind associates a socket address to the server.
        
        Socket address is a combination of IP address(32 bit for ipV4) + Port number(16 bit) = 48bits of socket address which Bind() adds to the server.
        
Once the Bind() function has been used, the server is now the passive mode, waiting for a request. That is done via the **listen() function.**

Listen function has a queue called *backlog*. This queue contains all the requests which is received by the server. 
Once the queue is full of requests and there is no space for new requests, the client will recieve a message that 
the queue is full and furthur requests can only be queued once the queue has some empty space.


At last, we use the **Accept()** fucntion. Once there are requests in the backlog of the listen() fucntion, 
it sends one by one the requests to get recieved. For recieving those requests, Accept() function is used.


**In the server, There are two fucntions. First one is the Socket and second one is Connect().**
Connect() function takes the socjket address, that is the ip address and port number of the server so that it could send requests to Listen() fucntion.

Now that the connection is establised, **Send() and recv()** fucntions are used to Write and read respectively.

Once the communication is completed, we use the **close()** function which terminates the process.
