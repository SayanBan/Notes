Normalization

   * Normalization is the process of organizing the data in the database.
   * Normalization is used to minimize the redundancy from a relation or set of relations. It is also used to eliminate the undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update and Deletion Anomalies.
   * Normalization divides the larger table into the smaller table and links them using relationship.
   * The normal form is used to reduce redundancy from the database table.

***FIRST NORMAL FORM***


   * A relation will be 1NF if it contains an atomic value.
   * It states that an attribute of a table cannot hold multiple values. It must hold only single-valued attribute.
   * First normal form disallows the multi-valued attribute, composite attribute, and their combinations.
   
***SECOND NORMAL FORM***

    * In the 2NF, relational must be in 1NF.
    * In the second normal form, all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key

***THIRD NORMAL FORM***

    * A relation will be in 3NF if it is in 2NF and not contain any transitive partial dependency.
    * 3NF is used to reduce the data duplication. It is also used to achieve the data integrity.
    * If there is no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes, then the relation must be in third normal form.

A relation is in third normal form if it holds atleast one of the following conditions for every non-trivial function dependency X → Y.

    * X is a super key.
    * Y is a prime attribute, i.e., each element of Y is part of some candidate key.
    
  ***Boyce Codd normal form (BCNF)***

   * BCNF is the advance version of 3NF. It is stricter than 3NF.
   * A table is in BCNF if every functional dependency X → Y, X is the super key of the table.
   * For BCNF, the table should be in 3NF, and for every FD, LHS is super key.
