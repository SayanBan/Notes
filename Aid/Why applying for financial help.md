I am a student from India, currently doing B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering. I got a scholarship which helps me to pay my fees. The scholarship is the only reason for which I have been able to study for a costly degree like Engineering. Besides that, I have no job which makes it impossible to carry even my own expenses or paying for a certified course. So I really need financial aid. This is the only way I can take this certified course. Also, because of this pandemic situation, job prospects and college placement, and everything else has messed up. The chances of getting a job have gone down. So it is really necessary skills which are in demand. My father is the only earning person in my family but he already is paying a large amount of money for the home loan so I cannot ask him to pay for my certifications. It would really be very helpful if you please grant me the financial aid.
