The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.

When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page. 

With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

    JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
    JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
    JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
    JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
    JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
    JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
    JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page


The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:

    The HTML elements as objects
    The properties of all HTML elements
    The methods to access all HTML elements
    The events for all HTML elements

In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.


The getElementById() method returns the element that has the ID attribute with the specified value.

The HTML DOM can be accessed with JavaScript (and with other programming languages).

In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as objects.

The programming interface is the properties and methods of each object.

A property is a value that you can get or set (like changing the content of an HTML element).

A method is an action you can do (like add or deleting an HTML element).

A JavaScript can be executed when an event occurs, like when a user clicks on an HTML element.


JavaScript HTML DOM Events

To execute code when a user clicks on an element, we add JavaScript code 'Onclick' to an HTML event attribute.

Examples of HTML events:

    When a user clicks the mouse
    When a web page has loaded
    When an image has been loaded
    When the mouse moves over an element
    When an input field is changed
    When an HTML form is submitted
    When a user strokes a key

JavaScript HTML DOM EventListener


Each available event has an event handler, which is a block of code (usually a JavaScript 
function that you as a programmer create) that runs when the event fires. 
When such a block of code is defined to run in response to an event, we say we are registering an event handler. 


The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to the specified element.

The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to an element without overwriting existing event handlers.

You can add many event handlers to one element.

You can add many event handlers of the same type to one element, i.e two "click" events.

The addEventListener() method makes it easier to control how the event reacts
