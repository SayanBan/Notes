I am a student currently having no source of income. Also as I mentioned before, my father who is the only earning member of my family is already paying up for the loan which he has taken for us. So there is no way that I can manage to have enough money to apply even for a loan. The only things which I can manage to afford dedication, concentration, determination, and Time.
