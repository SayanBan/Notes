**Abstraction**

It is a feature of OOPs. It is used to hide the unnecessary information or data from the user but shows the essential data that is useful for the user. 
It can be achieved by using the interface and the abstract class. In interfaces, only the methods are exposed to the end-user.

Example: A driver drives a car but its not really necessary for him to know the mechanisms on which the car works and all.

**Encapsulation**

It is also a feature of OOP. It is used to bind up the data into a single unit called class. 
It provides the mechanism which is known as data hiding. It is an important feature of OOPs. 
It prevents to access data members from the outside of the class. It is also necessary from the security point of view.

**Inheritance**

Inheritance in Java is the mechanism that allows a class to use properties and behaviors of an already existing class.
The already existing class is the parent class or superclass. The new class that inherits the properties and methods is called the child class or subclass. 
The main advantage of Inheritance is that it provides code reusability.

**Polymorphism**

Polymorphism in Java refers to an object showing different behaviors at different stages of its life cycle. 
There are mainly two types in polymorphism as overloading and overriding.
