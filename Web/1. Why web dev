Slide 1

hello everyone, This is Sayan and today basically we are going to revise the things that we have already done in web.

Okay now lets be honest, aren't we all choosing different tracks and learning new things with an ultimate goal, that is to get a job.

Given that there will be approximately 1.4 million computing jobs available in 2020, with only 400,000 qualified developers to fill them, 
those interested in acquiring in-demand skills can certainly benefit from having web development and coding in their resume. It’s safe 
to say there is, and will continue to be, high demand for web developers.

Tech is where to be right now. Because there is such a high demand for web developers and so little trained developers to fill those positions,
tech companies are doing an excellent job at making work like very comfortable, if not enjoyable. 



You can work from anywhere.

Have freedom to work whenever you want from wherever—imagine that. All you need for web development is the internet and a laptop. 
Not all jobs are remote, but if that is your preference, there are remote jobs out there for you. 

Web development gives you the opportunity to express yourself creatively on the internet. If you have an idea you would like to try as 
you discover your web dev skills, try it out. Web dev is a fun, creative experience.

Deciding a career will always be a difficult decision, especially when you’re unsure of what the outcome will be after you’ve invested time and money 
into learning a new trade. Fortunately, the high demand, easy-to-learn, 
fun-to-experience life of a web developer is always a great choice for someone ready to have an exciting career in code.
