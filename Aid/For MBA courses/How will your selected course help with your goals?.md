It's been some time since I have been looking into Business related jobs. Business-related jobs are the ones that interest me. They not only need to have a knowledge of the tech part but also have a keen knowledge of the company, and the projects. Also, they are the ones who not only get exposure to the tech world but also get exposure to the business side and see how actually the business works. I would love to be a part of the world of business, and hence, that is my goal, to become someone who can stand out of the queue. I have completed my Btech. But to get business-related jobs, I need to complete this course, only then I can have some validation and certification to get a relevant job. The best place for a course that would not only be relevant but also good enough to be recognized by organizations is Coursera. Hence, I would really be grateful if you kindly grant me the financial AID.
