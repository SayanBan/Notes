RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. RDBMS is the basis for SQL, and for all modern database systems like 
MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access.

A Relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model.

The data in an RDBMS is stored in database objects which are called as tables. 
This table is basically a collection of related data entries and it consists of numerous columns and rows

A **NULL** value in a table is a value in a field that appears to be blank, which means a field with a NULL value is a field with no value.
