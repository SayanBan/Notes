Visualforce pages are basic building blocks for developing an application. A Visualforce page is similar to a standard Web page, 
but includes powerful features to access, display, and update your organization's data.
Each tag in visual force language corresponds to some user interface component like section of a page, a list view or a field of an object.



Visualforce consists of a tag-based markup language that gives developers a 
more powerful way of building applications and customizing the Salesforce user interface.


Visualforce aids in the simple implementation of a companyâ€™s database.


Lightning components, on the other hand, are a completely new version of the interface that 
designs business web applications and makes them compliant with mobile and desktop services.


Visualforce The aim was to create a page-centric experience with minimal client-side logic.
Visualforce components are page-centric and most of the work is done on the server. 
while in Lightning Components are client-side centric, which makes them more dynamic and mobile friendly. 
Previously, clients had to request to the servers and servers use to process the request.
Now with lwc, clients don;t have to send requests to servers as the whole things is client centric.

Both the frameworks encompass some pros and cons associated with them. If you are developing for a Salesforce1 mobile app, 
you should prefer Lightning framework and if you want to create a page-centric experience with limited client-side logic, you must opt Visualforce framework.
