***CLUSTERED INDEX*** - sort and store the data rows in the table or view based on their key values
                        There can be only one clustered index per table
                        
                        Clustered index is created only when both the following conditions satisfy â€“

                            The data or file, that you are moving into secondary memory should be in sequential or sorted order.
                            There should be non key value, means the data should be unique.
                            
                            Clustered index is as same as dictionary where the data is arranged by alphabetical order.
                            
***NON CLUSTERED INDEX*** - 

The data is stored in one place, and index is stored in another place. Since, the data and non-clustered index is stored separately, 
then you can have multiple non-clustered index in a table.

The index of a book consists of a chapter name and page number, if you want to read any topic or chapter then you can directly go 
to that page by using index of that book. No need to go through each and every page of a book.

***Heaps*** - table without a clustered index 
              One or more nonclustered indexes can be created
              Data stored without specifying an order
              
**When to use Heap :**

      staging tables for large, unordered insert operations
      data always accessed through nonclustered indexes
      When RID is smaller than a clustered index key

***When not to use Heap :***

      when data frequently returned in a sorted order
      when data frequently grouped together
      when ranges of data frequently queried from the table
      With no nonclustered indexes and large table
      
      
***Unique Index***

      index key contains no duplicate values
      Multicolumn unique indexes guarantee that each combination of values in the index key is unique
      unique clustered index and multiple unique nonclustered indexes may be created
      
      
***Filtered Index***

      optimized nonclustered index
      cover queries that select from a well-defined subset of data
      uses a filter predicate to index a portion of rows in the table
      
  **Covering index** -- contains all the columns referenced by a query

   **Covered query** -- columns referenced by a query contained in an index
