***SCHEDULER***

Schedulers are special system software which handle process scheduling in various ways. 
Their main task is to select the jobs to be submitted into the system and to decide which process to run. Schedulers are of three types âˆ’

    Long-Term Scheduler
    Short-Term Scheduler
    Medium-Term Scheduler

***Long Term Scheduler***

It is also called a job scheduler. A long-term scheduler determines which programs are admitted to the system for processing. 
It selects processes from the queue and loads them into memory for execution. Process loads into the memory for CPU scheduling.

***Short Term Scheduler***

It is also called as CPU scheduler. Its main objective is to increase system performance in accordance with the chosen set of criteria. 
It is the change of ready state to running state of the process. CPU scheduler selects a process among the processes that are ready to execute and 
allocates CPU to one of them.

***Medium Term Scheduler***

Medium-term scheduling is a part of swapping. It removes the processes from the memory. It reduces the degree of multiprogramming. 
The medium-term scheduler is in-charge of handling the swapped out-processes.
