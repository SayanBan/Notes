There are two types of packets used at this layer :

    Data Packets –
    The user data is transferred in the inter-network by these data packets. Routed protocols are those protocols which support such data traffic. 
    Examples of routed protocols are IPv4, IPv6 and AppleTalk.
    
    Route Update Packets –
    The information about the networks connected to all the routers is updated to the neighbouring routers through route update packets. Routing protocols are 
    the ones that are responsible for sending them. Examples of routing protocols are RIP(Routing Information Protocol), EIGRP(Enhanced Interior 
    Gateway Routing Protocol) and OSPF(Open Shortest Path First).
