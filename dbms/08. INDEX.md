***CLUSTERED INDEX*** - sort and store the data rows in the table or view based on their key values
                        There can be only one clustered index per table
                        
                        Clustered index is created only when both the following conditions satisfy â€“

                            The data or file, that you are moving into secondary memory should be in sequential or sorted order.
                            There should be non key value, means the data should be unique.
                            
                            Clustered index is as same as dictionary where the data is arranged by alphabetical order.
                            
***NON CLUSTERED INDEX*** - 

The data is stored in one place, and index is stored in another place. Since, the data and non-clustered index is stored separately, 
then you can have multiple non-clustered index in a table.

The index of a book consists of a chapter name and page number, if you want to read any topic or chapter then you can directly go 
to that page by using index of that book. No need to go through each and every page of a book.
