As you can see in the code, we have taken 3 constants.
Now as you have already learned, The getElementById() method returns the element that has the ID attribute with the specified value.

Now if you see the html files, you will find the three IDs which has been specified here in get element by id.

next you can see the 'checkRequired' definition has been used. This is because if there is a box which you have by mistake not filled,
once you click submit, it'll show error.

You can see clearly it is just a simple if else condition which says input.value.trim() is equivalent to a blank then it will show 
the word Required when the submit button is clicked.

Now the next here this is another if else condition. This one is for the check boxes in the instrument option. 
if no instrument if chosen then it will show the sentense "Must choose an instrument", or else it will show okay.

Next function is for the clear button . 

The parentElement is another html DOM function. The parent element property returns the parent element of the specified element.
Now there are two cases mentioned here. one is when after submit, the form shows 'error' or when there is no error before or after submitting the form. 

In both cases, once you hit the clear button, it will erase all the user inputs from the form.

query selector is a dom function

The function of query selector is that If the selector matches an ID in document that is used several times, it returns the first matching element.

like there is the show error and show okay function which has used the query selector

so if it finda an error it will show error, that is the word "required" in red and if not, then it shows okay

The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to the specified element.

The getElementsByTagName() method returns a collection of all elements in the document with the specified tag name, as an HTMLCollection object.

The HTMLCollection object represents a collection of nodes. The nodes can be accessed by index numbers. The index starts at 0
here it will return all the elemts with the tag 'input'

The first add event listener is for the clear button and the second want is for the submit button.

At last there is 'check required input' and 'check required checkbox' , which are functions responsible for checking whether everything is okay or there is an error.
