The front end, also called “client-side” programming, is what happens in the browser. It’s everything the user sees and interacts with.

The back end, also called “server-side” programming, happens on the server and the database. It’s the machinery that works behind the scenes to power 
those fancy features users interact with on the client-side.

Both play a crucial role in web development and although they have their fair share of differences, they are like two sides of the same coin. 
Front-end is all about the visual aspects of the website that a user can see and experience. On the contrary, everything that happens in the
background can be attributed to the back-end web development. It’s more like an enabler for frontend web experience.

The developer of Front-end vs Back-end

The web designer is the most common job title for the frontend web development and the role of a web designer is to design and rebuild websites keeping 
the visual aspects in mind. Backend developers are the ones who make sure the data and systems requested by the frontend application or software are 
efficiently delivered. Backend developers handle everything that happens in the background.

The essentials of backend web development include languages such as Java, Ruby, Python, PHP, .Net, etc. 
The most common frontend languages are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
