It's been some time since I have been looking into Business analyst jobs. Business analyst jobs are the ones that interest me. They not only need to have a knowledge of the tech part but also have a keen knowledge of the company, and the projects. Also, they are the ones who do not only get exposure to the tech world but also get exposure to the business side and see how actually the business works. I would love to be a part of the world of business analysts, and hence, that is my goal, to become a business analyst. I am on the verge of completing my Btech. But to become a business analyst I need to complete this course, only then I can have some validation and certification to become a business analyst. Hence, it is my earnest request to you to kindly accept me for financial Air.
