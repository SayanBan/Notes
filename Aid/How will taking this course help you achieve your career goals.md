I am currently studying Btech in Computer science engineering. My career goal has always been straight, which is to be a good student and learn new skills even those which are not in the college curriculum. I constantly take up some free course or another so that I can constantly be in practice as coding needs practice for perfection. All of the given courses are very necessary for a student pursuing a degree in the computer science industry. Also when we take up a job after getting the degree, we should make sure that we are good at the skills required. The only way to assure that is by learning the skills in demand and keeping practicing them. So yes this course is going to help in every way, both for my learning and getting a job. I have seen many of my peers learning courses from Coursera and that they have been very much benefited from them. So this course will not only help me learn all the skills which are necessary but also to make significant progress in my journey as a computer science engineer.
